# tinyAcceleratedEVM
A [gymnax](https://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax) based EVM simulator written in the JAX machine learning framework. The idea is to write an EVM simulator that can be parallelized and gain significant performance boosts on the accelerated hardware such GPU/TPU. 

# Getting Started (WIP)

`python3 evm_sim.py` 

# Running the Demo

`python3 demo_evm_sim.py`
